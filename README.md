1. Add at least threee project features?
    *The first feature of this project is it is done by the react so the reloading time is very efficient.

    *The project has a functionality where if we select a course the course name is showing instantly in the course name section.

    *The project has another functionality that has we the remaining credit hours and the total credit hours exceeds the limit there a toast has been shown

2.Discuss how you manage the state in your project?
    *There is a built in hook called useState in react . I have just used the useState hook , the usestae hook returns an array of two elements, a setter function and a state variable which stores the state value . by using useState we can set an initial value. In my project I have just used three useState to manage the state , one for  selected course name, one for credit hours , and one for the total price.

# 2.Discuss how you manage the state in your project?
**Ans:**

    There is a built in hook called useState in react . I have just used the useState hook , the usestae hook returns an array of two elements, a setter function and a state variable which stores the state value . by using useState we can set an initial value. In my project I have just used three useState to manage the state , one for  selected course name, one for credit hours , and one for the total price.
